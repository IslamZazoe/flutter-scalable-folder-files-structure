 * In a large scale application,

 * Suppose we need to make use of our own custom RaisedButton, FlatButton, OutlineButton, 
 * Divider, CircularLoader, etc which we can use throughout our application
 *  then that kind of customization widgets we can add inside the file widget.dart which will be present inside the folder widgets
