/**
 * In many scenarios, we need to write code multiple times for the same thing like converting the every word first characters to be uppercase usually used in showing titles for any other widgets, etc. This kind of code can be made common to reduce the redundancy and add that code in helpers files which are present in lib/utils/helpers/text_helper.dart.
text_helper.dart will contain all the code which are required to convert the String to show in a Text widget.
